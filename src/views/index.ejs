  <h2>About this blog</h2>

  <p>Welcome! This is the home page of a blog about crossword puzzles and language.</p>

  <p>This blog might be for you if you're a casual solver or constructor of crossword puzzles. It'll look at things like common answers, bad fill, patterns in the grid, and change over time. Hopefully you'll come away with some new ideas borrowed from linguistics and backed up by data!</p>

  <p>If you're a linguist or a statistician, you may find some things oversimplified. I'm not an expert, but I'd love to hear from you if you are! And to the seasoned crossword aces, maybe the posts here will confirm what you already know about how words (mis)behave when you box them in.</p>
